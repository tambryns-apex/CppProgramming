short-circuit. if using "and" as an operator, and the first statement is false, then it will not evaluate the others and instead mark it as false.
Ex. #include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int number;
  cout << "Enter an integer: ";
  cin >> number;

  if (number % 2 == 0 && number % 3 == 0)
    cout << number << " is divisible by 2 and 3." << endl;

  if (number % 2 == 0 || number % 3 == 0)
    cout << number << " is divisible by 2 or 3." << endl;

  if ((number % 2 == 0 || number % 3 == 0) &&
       !(number % 2 == 0 && number % 3 == 0))
    cout << number << " divisible by 2 or 3, but not both." << endl;

  return(0);
}
Ternary operator: 
if (x > 0)
y = 1
else
y = -1;
is equivalent to
y = (x > 0) ? 1 : -1;
(booleanExpression) ? expression1 : expression2
